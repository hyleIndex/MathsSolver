\f0\fs24 \cf0 During these past 2-3 weeks (break), I completed the get_derivative() function with Lazar\'92s help. We came upon a few issues with the references to the left and right nodes of an AbstractFunction. There was also an issue with outputting the function as an AbstractFunction, so we decided to change the output to a string. I think worked on cleaning up the final derivative answer. There were a lot of extra parentheses so I cleaned that up through case analysis. The final step was to add the step by step solver - for this I created an auxiliary function to create a vector of strings that does not disappear and adds the steps chronologically as the get_derivative() function is recursive. Finally, I created functions to clean up the excess arithmetics (example - \'933+x+4\'94 = \'93x+7\'94). }
