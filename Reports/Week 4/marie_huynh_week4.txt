With the derivative team, we created a new branch and made sure everything compiled.
Then, this week, I restructured the token class and the simplify function in the respective cpp, hpp files. 
I created a file derivative testing for our team in the testing project of Lucien and tested out my tokenizer. 
With the help of Lazar, I debugged some mistakes (function is_letter wasn't working). 
After doing some tests, I found out that the majority of functions worked on my code, except one case 
(my code cannot do the difference between the x in "exp" and "x" (the variable)). 
Next, week I will try to fix that and work on linking our different parts in the team.
