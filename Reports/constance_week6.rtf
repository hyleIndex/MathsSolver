\f0\fs24 \cf0 This week, I continued testing the .solve() function and collaborated with Marie and Merlin to talk about some issue with the Tokenizer class and AbstractFunction constructor. There was a confusion with the composition operator and we were unsure of how to interpret it as a string and then a token. We have come to a conclusion together and will code these changes in the week to come. \
For my part I came along an issue with the AbstractFunction structure: the left and right attributes have to be AbstractFunctions but in some cases they will have to be one of the 6 basic functions. I have not found a solution, but I will come up with one in the coming week and finish testing the 5 different operators. }
