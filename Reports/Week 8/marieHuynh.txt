During vacation, I finished debugging and updating the parsing part (especially simplify)
 I took into account decimals, digits with multiple numbers, came up with Merlin with the 
supertoken concept for composition and implemented it, dealt with parentheses. 

This week, Lazar helped me debugging one final bug in simplify and I implemented and 
tested some functions to check for string validity (parentheses, operators, ...). I will
implement some last functions to simplify the output of the derivative solver and review
everything one last time.
